Oasis Infobyte - Web Development & Designing Internship
Duration: July 2025 â€“ August 2025
Role: Web Development & Designing Intern

During this internship at Oasis Infobyte, I successfully completed several frontend development projects that helped me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tasks involved building interactive and responsive web applications while applying core concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design.

The projects I completed include:

Basic Calculator: A simple web-based calculator that performs basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a clean and user-friendly interface.

Tribute Page: A responsive tribute webpage created using HTML and CSS to honor a notable individual, focusing on layout and styling techniques.

To-Do Web App: A dynamic to-do list application where users can add, delete, and manage tasks efficiently with real-time updates using JavaScript.

Login Authentication: A basic login form showcasing front-end validation and UI design for user authentication.

These projects helped me gain hands-on experience with frontend technologies and version control using Git and GitHub. I managed all my code and submissions in a single GitHub repository named OIBSIP, as per the internship guidelines.
